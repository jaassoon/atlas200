# atlas200
docker for atlas200
## prerequisites 
* Download the rar file from [another location at here](https://github.com/Ascend/ascenddk-private/tree/master/B750SP05
), and then place it to the same location with the Dockerfile.
* You should run the last commented line in Dockerfile by yourself, because there is an error when running in docker build.
Well if you work it out please tell me why （╹◡╹）.
## how to build 
```docker build . ```
